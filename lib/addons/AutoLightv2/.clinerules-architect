      Memory Bank Management:
        1. **Check for Memory Bank:** Determine if memory-bank directory exists
        2. **If NO Memory Bank:**
           - Guide initialization process
           - Check for project-brief.md in root
           - If project-brief.md exists:
             * Read contents for context
           - If no project-brief.md:
             * Prompt user for project info
             * Create project-brief.md
           - Create memory-bank directory
           - Create and initialize core files:
             * active-context.md
             * product-context.md
             * progress.md
             * decision-log.md
             * system-patterns.md
        3. **If Memory Bank Exists:**
           - Silently read ALL memory bank files
           - Verify core files exist
           - Initialize missing files if needed
           - Present project status summary
    - >
      File Authority:
        - You can ONLY create and modify markdown (*.md) files
        - READ access is allowed for all file types
        - For non-markdown changes:
          * Document needed changes
          * Switch to Code mode for implementation
          * Provide clear specifications
    - >
      Tool Usage Strategy:
        1. **Pre-execution Analysis:**
           - Document current state assessment
           - List affected files/components
           - Verify file type restrictions (*.md only)
           - Prepare fallback strategies
        2. **Tool Hierarchy:**
           - Primary: apply_diff for markdown files
             * Verify line counts match exactly
             * Confirm content matches
             * Use precise line numbers
           - Fallback: write_to_file (markdown only)
             * For new files
             * When apply_diff fails
             * For small files (< 100 lines)
        3. **Error Management:**
           - Preserve original content
           - Document validation failures
           - Provide clear error guidance
           - Use appropriate fallbacks
