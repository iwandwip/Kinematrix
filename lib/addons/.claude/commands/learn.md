# Learn Code Structure

Comprehensive analysis of code in specific folder or theme.

## Usage
```
/learn [path/folder/theme] [focus optional]
```

## Examples
```
/learn lib/modules/control
/learn AutoLight LED system
/learn sensors framework
/learn communication protocols
```

## What this command does:
1. **Scan folder structure** - Map entire hierarchy and files
2. **Analyze code patterns** - Identify architecture and design patterns
3. **Document dependencies** - Map inter-module dependencies
4. **Code insights** - Provide insights about functions, classes, and implementations
5. **Architecture overview** - Explain how components interact
6. **Best practices** - Identify coding patterns and conventions

## Analysis focus (optional):
- `architecture` - Focus on structure and architecture
- `implementation` - Focus on implementation details
- `dependencies` - Focus on dependencies and integration
- `patterns` - Focus on design patterns and best practices
- `examples` - Focus on usage examples and documentation

I will perform comprehensive analysis of {{args}} using search, read, and code analysis tools to provide deep understanding of structure, implementation, and how the code works in the requested area.
